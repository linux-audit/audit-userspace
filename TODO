Things that need to be done:
===========================
2.3.3
* Fix auvirt to report AVC's and --proof for --all-events
* Add command report
* Fix auparse to handle out of order messages
* If auparse input is a pipe timeout events by wall clock

2.4
* Add audit by process name support
* Add rule verify to detect mismatch between in-kernel and on-disk rules
* Fix SIGHUP for auditd network settings

2.4.1
* Fix ausearch/report to handle aggregated events
* When searching, build log time list & only read the ones that are in range
* Change ausearch-string to be AVL based
* Performance improvements for auparse
* Add libaudit.m4 to make audit easier to include
* Look at adding the direction read/write to file report (threat modelling)
* Changes in uid/gid, failed changes in credentials in aureport
* aureport get specific reports working
* auditctl should ignore invalid arches for rules
* Remove evil getopt cruft in auditctl
* Group message types in ausearch help.

2.5
* Look at pulling audispd into auditd
* Add gzip format for logs
* Consider adding node/machine name to records going to rt interface in daemon    as protocol version 2.
* Fix retry logic in distribute event, buffer is freed by the logger thread
* interpret contexts
* Add keywords for time: month-ago
* Allow -F path!=/var/my/app
* Add ignore action for rules
* Look at openat and why passed dir is not given
* Add SYSLOG data source for auparse. This allows leading text before audit       messages, missing type, any line with no = gets thrown away. iow, must have     time and 1 field to be valid.
* Update auditctl so that if syscall is not found, it checks for socket call      and suggests using it instead. Same for IPCcall.
* Fix aureport accounting for avc in permissive mode
* rework ausearch to use auparse
* rework aureport to use auparse

2.6
* Consolidate parsing code between libaudit and auditd-conf.c
* Look at variadic avc logging patch 
* If relative file in cwd, need to build also (realpath). watch out for (null) and socket
* Change ausearch to output name="" unless its a real null. (mount) ausearch-report.c, 523. FIXME
* add more libaudit man pages
* ausearch --op search
* Fix aureport-scan to properly decide if CONFIG_CHANGE is add or del, need to optionally look for op and use remove/add to decide

2.7
Add scheduling options: strict, relaxed, loose (determines user space queueing)
Allow users to specify message types to be kept for logging
Allow users to specify fields to be kept for logging
Pretty Print ausearch messages (strace style?)
Look at modifying kernel rule matcher to do: first match & match all
