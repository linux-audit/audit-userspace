 * This function returns 1 if it is the last record in an event.

 * When processing an event stream we define the end of an event via

 *   record type = AUDIT_PROCTITLE   (we note the AUDIT_PROCTITLE is always
 *                                    the last record), or
 *   record type = AUDIT_KERNEL (kernel events are one record events), or
 *   record type < AUDIT_FIRST_EVENT (only single record events appear
 *                                    before this type), or
 *   record type >= AUDIT_FIRST_ANOM_MSG (only single record events appear
 *                                      after this type), or
