.SH NAME
auditd-plugins \- realtime event receivers
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBauditd\fP can multiplex audit events in realtime. It takes audit events and distributes them to child programs that want to analyze events in realtime. When the audit daemon receives a SIGTERM or SIGHUP, it passes that signal to its child processes so that can reload the configuration or terminate.

The child programs install a configuration file in a plugins directory which defaults to \fI/etc/audit/plugins.d\fP. This can be controlled by a auditd.conf config option
.B plugin_dir
if the admin wished to locate plugins somewhere else. But auditd will install its plugins in the default location.

The plugin directory will be scanned and every plugin that is active will be started. If the plugin has a problem and exits, it will be started a maximum of
.B max_restarts
times as found in auditd.conf.

Config file names are not allowed to have more than one '.' in the name or it will be treated as a backup copy and skipped. Config file options are given one per line with an equal sign between the keyword and its value. The available options are as follows:

.TP
.I active
The options for this are 
.IR yes
or
.IR no.
.TP
.I direction
The option is dictated by the plugin.
.IR In
or
.IR out
are the only choices. You cannot make a plugin operate in a way it wasn't designed just by changing this option. This option is to give a clue to the event dispatcher about which direction events flow. NOTE: inbound events are not supported yet.
.TP
.I path
This is the absolute path to the plugin executable. In the case of internal plugins, it would be the name of the plugin.
.TP
.I type
This tells the dispatcher how the plugin wants to be run. Choices are
.IR builtin
and
.IR always.
.IR Builtin
should always be given for plugins that are internal to the audit event dispatcher. These are af_unix and syslog. The option
.IR always
should be given for most if not all plugins. The default setting is
.IR always.
.TP
.I args
This allows you to pass arguments to the child program. Generally plugins do not take arguments and have their own config file that instructs them how they should be configured. At the moment, there is a limit of 2 args.
.TP
.I format
The valid options for this are
.IR binary
and
.IR string.
.IR Binary
passes the data exactly as the audit event dispatcher gets it from the audit daemon. The
.IR string
option tells the dispatcher to completely change the event into a string suitable for parsing with the audit parsing library. The default value is
.IR string.
