## This set of rules is to negate the performance effects of the audit system
## by preventing syscall auditing to work. You would use this when you want
## the best system performance without a properly working audit system. 
## As a result, you only get hardwired events. If you need syscall auditing,
## delete this file and install 10-base-config.rules + other files to make
## your audit policy.

## First rule - delete all
-D

## This suppresses syscall auditing for all tasks.
-a task,never
